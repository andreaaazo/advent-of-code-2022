# Advent of Code Solutions

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems in Python3.

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## Running Solutions

To run a solution, `cd` into its directory and invoke the program:

```bash
# day_1
cd day_1

python day_1.py
```

Environments:

- Python `v3.10`
